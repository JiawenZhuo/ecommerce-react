# E-commerce product page

## Overview

### Motivation

The purpose of this project was initially to complete E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor. The challenge provides design guide on product page only. After compeleting this single-page project I decided to challenged myself by expanding it into a full-stack web application with all essential functions.

I am still in the middle of completing it. 

### Build with
* Semantic HTML5 markup 
* CSS custom properties 
* Flexbox 
* Styled-component 
* react.js

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
* Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
* Add items to the cart
* View the cart and remove items from it
